## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- The `install` and `build` commands take a nix argument list as their argv.
  Since we switched to a command line parsing library, it needs to be split
  from the spago2nix command with `--` now.

  So if you previously had, for example,

      spago2nix build --arg pkgs "import ./nixpkgs {}"

  this now fails with an error like

      invalid option `--arg`

  and needs to be rewritten to

      spago2nix build -- --arg pkgs "import ./nixpkgs {}"

### Added

- Global option `--cache-dir` to set the cache directory
- `build` and `build-nix` option `--spago-dhall` to override the dhall entrypoint


## [0.2.0] - 2019-06-16
